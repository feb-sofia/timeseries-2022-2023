# Time series analysis 2022/2023

## Homework project

Please open the homework registration link: https://classroom.github.com/a/FYFopzPe

- You need a working (GitHub.com)[github.com] account as you will be asked to
  log in to GitHub.
- When you open the registration link for the first time, please select your student id from the list. If you can't find your student id there, please contact me: boyko.amarov@gamil.com.
- The homework is a group assignment. Each group has a limit of 5 members.
  The first member of your group should create a team when he or she visits the
  registration link. The other team members can select that team and join it.
- After you select your team, you will be redirected to a page showing a link
  to your homework GitHub repository.
- The GitHub repository will be empty initially. I will upload the assignments
  when all the teams are formed, then you can find it under a "Homework_xxx.Rmd"
  file in your repository.
- When your assignment is available, you should download it from the repository
  and open it with R-Studio.
- Don't forget to write the student ids and the names of the group members
  in the solutions file.
- When you are finished with the solution, please upload it back into that repository.
  To do that, open the original assignment file (on the repository page), find the
  pencil icon and click on it. This will put the file in edit mode. Copy the contents of
  your solution, and paste it into the GitHub editor, replacing the original content.
  Click on the green "Commit" button at the bottom of the page. Verify that your
  solution is correctly uploaded by opening file in GitHub one more time.
- Take care to really replace the assignment files with your solution. Please do not upload additional `Rmd` files to your repository. At the end your repository must contain only *one* Rmd file. 
- Verify that your code works by clicking on the "Knit" button in R-Studio. It
  should compile a web-page with your solution. If the web-page does not appear,
  this means that there are errors in your code that need to be fixed.
- Each group submits only _one_ solution for the whole team.

## Grading
